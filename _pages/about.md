I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [European Institute, London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk/european-institute "LSE European Institute"). I work in the fields of comparative and international political economy, mostly covering British and European Union politics. My subject expertise lies in financial regulation/innovation, macroeconomic governance, European integration and the impact of Brexit on the EU. 

I enjoy working with both qualitative and quantitative data and methods. I have training and [publishing]([url](https://www.joeganderson.net/publications/)) experience in elite interviewing, historical comparative case studies (process tracing), public opinion surveys and quantitative text analysis.     

I hold a BA in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield, an MA in International Political Economy from King's College London, and an MRes and DPhil in Social and Political Sciences from the European University Institute (Italy), Florence.

My doctoral dissertation was recognised as an EUI Thesis of the Month. You can read a summary [here](https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/68560 "Thesis of the Month"). 

Between my postgrad and doctoral studies, I spent three years working for the EdTech startup [Quipper](https://www.quipper.com/en/) in London, Southeast Asia and Mexico.

Born and raised in Nottingham, I am now based near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.

Current Work and Research
======

At the LSE, I am a team member on the ERC-funded project Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics: Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post-2008 (SOLID). SOLID brings together political scientists across three universities (LSE, EUI, University of Milan) and aims to make sense of the EUâ€™s crisis politics and its implications for the emerging European polity.
