I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute at the London School of Economics. My interests include comparative political economy, British and EU politics, with a particular focus on financial regulation and taxation.

I have a BA in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield. I was awarded a postgraduate innovation scholarship to continue my studies at King’s College London, where I received an MA (Pass with Distinction) in International Political Economy. 

I obtained an MRes and DPhil from the EUI, where my dissertation was recognised as thesis of the month. You can read a summary [here](http://github.com "Thesis of the Month"). 

Between my postgrad and doctoral studies I spent three years working for the EdTech startup Quipper in London, South East Asia and Mexico.

My Work and Research
======

At the LSE, I am a team member on the ERC-funded project Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics: Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post-2008 (SOLID). SOLID brings together political scientists across three universities (LSE, EUI, University of Milan) and aims to make sense of the EU’s crisis politics and its implications for the emerging European polity.
