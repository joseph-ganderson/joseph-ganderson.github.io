I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute, London School of Economics. My interests include comparative political economy, British and EU politics, with a particular focus on financial regulation and taxation. 

I enjoy working with both qualitative and quantitative data and methods. I have training and publishing experience in elite interviewing, historical comparative case studies, public opinion surveying and quantitative text analysis.     

I hold a BA in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield, an MA in International Political Economy from King's College London, and an MRes and DPhil from the European University Institute (EUI).

My doctoral dissertation was recognised as an EUI Thesis of the Month. You can read a summary [here](https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/68560 "Thesis of the Month"). 

Between my postgrad and doctoral studies, I spent three years working for the EdTech startup Quipper in London, South East Asia and Mexico.

Born and raised in Nottingham, I now live near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.

Current Work and Research
======

At the LSE, I am a team member on the ERC-funded project Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics: Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post-2008 (SOLID). SOLID brings together political scientists across three universities (LSE, EUI, University of Milan) and aims to make sense of the EUâ€™s crisis politics and its implications for the emerging European polity.
