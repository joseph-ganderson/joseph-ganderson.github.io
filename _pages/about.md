*Please note this website covers my academic research only, and not my work in the Publishing Ethics and Research Integrity (PERI) team at Cambridge University Press.*

I am a political scientist and visiting researcher at the Department of Social and Political Sciences, University of Milan. 

### Interests and Research

My primary research and teaching interests are in the political economy of finance and taxation, European Union and British politics. My subject expertise lies in financial regulation/innovation, macroeconomic governance, European integration and Brexit. 

I enjoy working with both qualitative and quantitative data and methods. I have training and [publishing](https://www.joeganderson.net/publications/) experience in elite interviewing, historical comparative case studies (process tracing), public opinion surveys design/analysis, and quantitative text analysis. My academic research has featured in the journals _West European Politics_, _Comparative European Politics_, _Review of International Organizations_, _Business & Politics_, _Political Quarterly_, _Government & Opposition_ and _Political Studies Review_.

I also have undergraduate and graduate teaching, supervision and module convening experience in British politics, EU politics and political economy. My teaching was awarded 'Highly Commended' status at the LSE, and I was nominated by students for 'Exceptional Teaching in an Unprecedented Year' for my approach to teaching through Covid-19. In 2024-25, I was Associate Lecturer in European Politics at the Department of Political Science and School of Public Policy, UCL.

### Qualifications and Background

I have a BA in International Relations and Politics from the University of Sheffield (First-Class Hons.), an MA in International Political Economy from King's College London (with Distinction), and an MRes and DPhil in Social and Political Sciences from the European University Institute, Florence. My doctoral dissertation was recognised as an EUI Thesis of the Month. You can read a summary [here](https://cadmus.eui.eu/handle/1814/68560 "Thesis of the Month").

Between my gradudate and doctoral studies, I spent three years working for the EdTech startup [Quipper](https://www.quipper.com/en/) in London, Southeast Asia and Mexico.

### Current Research and Posts

At Unimi, I am a team member on the ERC-funded project Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics: Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post-2008 (SOLID). SOLID brings together political scientists across three universities (LSE, EUI, Milan) and aims to make sense of the EU’s crisis politics and its implications for the emerging European polity.
